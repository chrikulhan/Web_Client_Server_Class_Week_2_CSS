<!--  Adding an image to my webpage-->

<p>Here's a photo of some ceramic pots:</p>

<!--<img starts to tell the computer where to get the image,
alt = the alternative text that pops up when you hover over the image, or for accessibility
title = what shows up in the tag about the item (at the top)
height = you can resize an image, and only need to put height OR width if you want and the computer
will adjust the other dimension to remain true to the image.
-->
<img
        src="jessica-ruscello-pots-copy copy.jpg"
        alt="Multi-colored mouths of ceramic pots"
        title="Pot mouths"
        height = 300>
